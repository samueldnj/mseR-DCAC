Herring Results:
- Batch didn't correctly run different mortality trajectories. Weird. So half the Herring runs are superfluous. Fix this.

- For historical M:
    + Summary: Rule seems to react as it should, though seems very insensitive to trend detection windows (power) and probabilities (false pos/neg rates). Study of other trend detection techniques is required. Catch base rule with states included performs the most conservatively, always delivering the lowest probabilities of dipping below critB0 and fishing above Fmsy and highest final depletion. 
    + Next steps should be to run tests with different combinations of DM, HCR and Trend settings all together to test deeper and find "optimal" settings
    + Should also test survey frequencies.
    - DM:
        + Catch based:
            + probCritB0, Final Depletion, AAV and Average Catch don't seem very sensitive to Dm or Mm, except for when Mm = 0.5 and Dm = 2 and Mv > 0.6, then the estimate of MSY (DCAC) explodes.
            + AAV is always < 10 %
            + For low CVs <= 0.6 of M, AvgCatch has Q2 <= 12.
            + Key is to overestimate M to avoid overfishing. At 2*M with a CV of 1, P (Ft > Fmsy) < 40, and it decreases with Dm, Dv and Mv.
        + Quant based is dumb. Avoid quantile based rule.
    - HCR:
        + Catch:
            * Doesn't appear to be very sensitive to positive and negative gradients across proportions of DCAC
            * Proportions of DCAC really drive the performance of the MP here. WHY? Probably due to *very* small trends (~3e-2)
            * With state based rule turned on and dcacCons = 1, final depletion bottoms out at 0.5, and increases with decreasing dcacCons
            * medFinalDep decreases with increasing PG and decreasing NG. Depletion decreases with increasing Pr in both state and stateless models. dcacCons (Pr) should be set around 0.6 to avoid under-exploitation of this stock.
            * medAAV increases with PG and decreasing NG, and decreases with Pr. State based rule increases AAV, due to state influencing the HCR.
            * medAvgCatch increases with PG and NG too, increases also with Pr.
    - Trend:
        + Catch:
            *
